# CameraCtrl+F (Python Singular Version)

_This is a [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) text detection and text location project built using python. The core OCR utilization of OpenCV is copied from [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/text-detection-and-extraction-using-opencv-and-ocr/) on [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) and has been modified to allow for searching detected text. Press esc key to exit or the enter key to locate the text inside the brackets (type anywhere). To adjust the area of detected text move the slider. The default setting should work with detecting individual words with best results coming from black on white text . Using Tesseract for text-detection. Tested on  MacOS._
